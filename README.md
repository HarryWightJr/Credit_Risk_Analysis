# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, we used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, we compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Finally, we evaluated the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
